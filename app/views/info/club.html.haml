        Welcome to the Sydney Sub Aqua Club. The club was formed in 2004 as a non-profit diving club and is
        =link_to "part of BSAC.", "http://www.bsac.com", target: "new"
      %p SSAC is not tied to any commercial dive shop and provides members with regular diving at a non-commercial price in a true club environment.
      We welcome divers from other affiliations such as PADI and SSI - if you have your open water dive certificate and want to expand your diving experience in a sociable club environment you're welcome to join us.
      %p Dives are arranged around the Sydney area and the club also runs trips further afield in Australia and worldwide.
      We're a mix of open water, technical, rebreather, photographer, wreck and wildlife divers so there's always something for everyone.

        Club members are mostly experienced divers and instructors, however we are a small club and do not currently run regular training courses.
        Training may be arranged with individual instructors, who are often happy provide training to students at their own pace and at no extra charge beyond the BSAC membership and BSAC training fees..
